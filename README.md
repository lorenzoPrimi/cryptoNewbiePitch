### Crypto newbie pitch

This simple readme hopes to answer the questions asked by the crypto newbie bounty for the 0xHackathon.

TODO partially complete - will do when wake up.

What is the intended target demographic?

- As our app is inspired in the Christmas game White Elephant, we're targeting friends and family members who want to have a fun time swapping their tokens

What problem are you solving for them?

- As COVID-19 spread throughout different countries, the traditional White Elephant game has come increasingly difficult to be done in person. With our app, we're presenting a completely virtual and decentralized alternative, which anyone with ERC20s can join

How painful is their problem?

- As connection and ways to have fun along other people has come increasingly difficult, we hope that our solution improves at least a bit the well being of those who uses it

How many people are affected?

- Everyone that cannot see their family/friends for any reasons

Why wouldn't they just use a non-blockchain alternative?

- Our whole app is designed around ETH and its vibrant ecosystem, so it will be difficult to think of an exact analogy

What is the proper technical stack for a newbie-friendly application?

- Metamask and Uniswap
